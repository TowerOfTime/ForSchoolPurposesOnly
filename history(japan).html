        <h1 style="color: #ffffff;">History</h1>
    <p style="color: #ffffff">In ancient times, the land that would become Nihonsei was ruled by powerful dragons and fierce beasts. The gods looked down upon this land and saw the potential for something great. They created a great warrior, <a href="./yamato.html">Yamato</a>, and tasked him with the mission of taming the land and bringing order to its inhabitants.
    Yamato bravely fought against the beasts, driving them back and establishing the first settlements in the land. As he traveled, he discovered many new and exotic ingredients that would one day become staples of Japanese cuisine. He found succulent fish in the streams, tender game in the forests, and hearty vegetables in the fields.
    Yamato's people soon began to cultivate these ingredients and develop new techniques for cooking and preserving them. They created rich broths, savory sauces, and delicate sushi rolls that would come to be beloved by all. And as their cuisine grew in popularity, so too did the power and influence of the Yamato dynasty.
    Over time, the Yamato emperors expanded their territory and established a great empire that spanned the length and breadth of the land. And as their power grew, so too did the sophistication and diversity of their cuisine. They created new dishes that blended the flavors of the east and west, incorporating spices and ingredients from across the world.
    Today, Japan is renowned for its culinary traditions, which continue to evolve and adapt to the changing tastes of the world. And though the dragons and beasts of old may be long gone, the legacy of Yamato and his people lives on in every delicious bite of Japanese food.
    Back then, they already have food like, Sea Dragon Rolls, Golden Dragon bites, Jade Sea Gems, Dragon's Breath Broth, and Dragon's Whiskers Noodles.</p>
