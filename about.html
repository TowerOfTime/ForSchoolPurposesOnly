    <h1 style="color: #ffff;">OverView:</h1>
    <p style="color: #ffff;">Tower of Nations is a multiplayer text-based MMORPG where players represent their countries in a battle to reach the top of a tower. Each country sends their strongest warrior to fight against other nations' representatives in the tower, with the ultimate goal of being the first to reach the top. Players will need to strategize and use their wits to defeat their opponents in order to reach the final level of the tower.</p>
    <h1 style="color: #ffff;">Gameplay:</h1>
    <p style="color: #ffff;">The tower consists of multiple levels, each with its own set of challenges and obstacles. Players must work their way through each level by defeating enemy characters and solving puzzles. The tower also contains hidden treasures and rewards that players can collect along the way.

      At the beginning of the game, players will be asked to choose a country to represent. Each country will have its own representative character with unique abilities and strengths. As players progress through the levels, they will unlock new skills and abilities for their character.
      
      In addition to battling against other players' representatives, players can also team up with other players to take on challenges together. The game also includes a chat feature that allows players to communicate with each other, form alliances, and strategize together.
      
      The game ends when one player's representative reaches the top of the tower. The winning country's representative will be crowned as the champion of the Tower of Nations.
      
      Are you ready to represent your country and take on the challenge of the Tower of Nations?</p>
